Hail, and well-met!
 
Welcome to HelbreathUSA!  If 
you are a new player please 
check out the information on 
character development on the 
HelbreathUSA website.  Try a 
character first for a few levels 
before you design your Free 50th 
level character.  Our GameMasters 
will be glad to give you advice 
about that as will many of our 
friendly players!
 
Do not share accounts.  There is 
no reason for anyone to need a 
screenshot of an item you have.  
If you are going to do a trade get 
assistance from our GMs or take 
screenshots of the trade window.  
When you get something good or 
change gear go to a different map 
or log out and back in to save the 
character changes.  This will 
prevent any problems in event of a 
server crash.
 
Please keep in mind that you can 
despise the enemy townfolk but we 
do not permit real-world racism in 
this game.  Keep your language clean 
in public chat, please.
 
Enjoy the game, grow strong and kill 
many of the enemy!
 
GM1
